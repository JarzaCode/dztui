== DZG-003: On Steam Deck, DayZ becomes unresponsive/sluggish over time
Last updated: {d}

When DayZ is open for 1+ hours, a gradual loss in performance and FPS may occur on the Steam Deck.

A solution that seems to work for most users is to install https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities[Cryo Utilities], a third-party performance management application.
