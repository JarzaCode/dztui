== DZG-006: After moving DayZ to another drive, DZGUI fails to locate it on initial setup
Last updated: {d}

If you recently moved the location of DayZ using Steam's internal dialogs, it may take some time for this information to update internally on Steam's side.

Steam stores the location of installed games in a unified file, and DZGUI checks this file during initial setup to determine where Steam claims DayZ is installed.

If you recently moved DayZ to a different drive or partition but did not restart Steam, this information may be out of date, causing Steam to report the wrong location.

Try restarting the Steam client and starting the DZGUI initial setup again.
