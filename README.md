## What this is

- BETA TESTING BRANCH -

A GUI version of [DZTUI](https://github.com/aclist/dztui) for Linux. Used to list community server details and quick connect to preferred servers by staging mods and concatenating launch options automatically.  

DZGUI allows you to connect to modded/community DayZ servers on Linux and provides a graphical interface for doing so. This overcomes certain limitations in the Linux client and helps prepare the game to launch by doing the following:

1. Display server metadata in a table (server data and ID, player count, ping, current gametime)
2. Find and prepare mods being requested by the server
3. Concatenate launch options to pass to Steam

## Setup and usage

Refer to the [manual](https://aclist.github.io/dzgui/dzgui.html) for installation and setup instructions, a feature-by-feature breakdown, and Steam integration tutorials.
