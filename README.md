# DZGUI

Preliminary experimental branch of GUI mode for DZTUI. For use on Steam Deck, desktop, etc.

Not implemented yet:
- Additional error handling (API return code validation, mod validation)
- Mod check and symlink creation (initial prototype only supports connecting dumbly to servers you have mods for -- purely a GUI launcher to facilitate Steam Deck usage)

Must be used on servers/mods already confirmed working with DZTUI or you will encounter bugs. Mod validation still being ported over from DZTUI.
